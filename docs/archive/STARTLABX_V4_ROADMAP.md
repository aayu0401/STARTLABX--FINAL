# 🚀 StartLabX V4: The Outcome Engine (Strategy & Exec)

## 🎯 Vision: From "Tool" to "Behavioral Startup OS"
The previous versions gave users *tools*. V4 will give them *consequences*.
We are building a **Feedback Loop** where **Execution = Reward** and **Stagnation = Restriction**.

This is the difference between a "Playground" and a "Company Builder."

## 🏗️ Phase 1: The "Consequence Engine" (Behavioral Logic)
**Objective**: Implementing the "Execution → Proof → Reward" Loop.

### 1.1 🔒 Outcome Unlocking System
*   **Logic**: Features are no longer just "there". They must be *earned*.
*   **Rules**:
    *   `Traction < 20`: **Hidden** from Investor Feed. **Talent Matches** limited to "Co-Founders" (equity only).
    *   `Traction > 40`: **Unlocks** "Growth Hacker" talent search. **Visible** to Angel Investors.
    *   `Traction > 70`: **Unlocks** "VC Deal Flow". **Featured** on "Launch Feed".
*   **UI**: "Locked" states on Dashboard cards with explicit instruction: *"Ship MVP to unlock Investor Access."*

### 1.2 📉 Failure Pattern Engine (Anti-Delusion)
*   **Feature**: `RiskAnalysis` Module.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   Slow Development Velocity (GitHub).
    *   High Burn / No Market Signal (Simulated Financials).
    *   Team Gaps (e.g., Solo Technical Founder with no Sales).
*   **Output**: "StartLabX Warning: You are matching a 85% Failure Pattern. **Pivot Recommended**."

### 1.3 🗓️ Founder Operating Rhythm (Retention)
*   **Feature**: Weekly "Board Meeting" with AI.
*   **Action**: Every Monday, the AI Agent asks: "What did you ship last week?"
*   **Streak**: "Execution Streak: 4 Weeks". Displayed on Profile to Investors.
*   **Penalty**: Miss 2 weeks -> Traction Score drops by 10 points.

## 🤝 Phase 2: Commitment & Legal Layer
**Objective**: Making it "Real".

### 2.1 📜 Smart Contracts (Soft)
*   **Feature**: `EquitySplit` Simulator.
*   **UI**: Co-Founders agree to a split (e.g., 50/50) inside the app.
*   **Effect**: This "Soft Contract" is recorded in the project history. "Signed by [User] on [Date]".

## 🧠 Phase 3: The Knowledge Graph (Moat)
**Objective**: Compounding Intelligence.

### 3.1 🕸️ Startup Graph
*   **Data Point**: Every pivot, every failed milestone feeds the global graph.
*   **Insight**: "Founders who pivoted at this stage had a 3x higher success rate."

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan (V4 Sprint)

1.  **Database Upgrade**:
    *   Add `RiskAnalysis` model.
    *   Add `EquityAllocation` model.
    *   Update `StartupProject` with `tractionLevel` (Locked/Unlocked states).

2.  **Dashboard Logic**:
    *   Implement "Locked View" for Investor Access.
    *   Add "Weekly Reset" timer for Execution Streak.

3.  **Governance**:
    *   Implement the "Board Meeting" chat flow logic.

Let's begin with **Phase 1: The Consequence Engine (Locking Features based on Traction)**.
