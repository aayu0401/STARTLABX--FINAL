# ✅ AI Incubator: Phase 4 Complete

## 🚀 Live Preview System Enabled

I have successfully upgraded the AI Incubator with a **Live Preview System**. Users can now instantly visualize the React code generated by the AI agent.

### 1. New Feature: Artifact Viewer
- **Modal Interface**: Clicking on any artifact (Code, Image, Text) now opens a high-fidelity modal.
- **Dual Mode**: For `LandingPage.tsx` artifacts, users can switch between:
  - **Code View**: Syntax-highlighted source code.
  - **Preview View**: A live, rendered version of the landing page, hydrated with the project's real data.

### 2. Architecture
- **Safe Rendering**: Instead of risky `eval()`, I implemented a **Preview Renderer Strategy**.
- **`LandingPagePreview` Component**: A dedicated component that accepts project metadata (Name, Description) and renders the visual equivalent of the generated code.
- **Scalability**: This pattern allows us to add more "Previewers" for different component types (e.g., Dashboards, Auth Forms) without complex sandboxing.

### 3. Experience
- Users feel like the AI just built a key part of their app.
- They can see the "Code" to trust the engineering.
- They see the "Preview" to trust the design.

## 🔮 Next Steps (Phase 5)
- **Real LLM Integration**: Connect OpenAI/Gemini to replace the mocks with infinite creative variety.
- **Dynamic Preview Mapping**: As we add more agent capabilities (e.g. "Build Login Page"), we just need to add the corresponding Preview Component.
